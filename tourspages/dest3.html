            Rara Lake, also known as Mahendra Lake, is the largest freshwater lake in the Nepalese Himalayas and the central feature of Rara National Park, which stretches over 106 km<sup>2</sup>. Located in the Jumla and Mugu districts of Karnali Province, the lake is a must-visit destination for nature lovers.
          </p>
          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Rara Lake was included in Rara National Park in 1976. Later, in September 2007, it was designated as a Ramsar site, covering 1,583 hectares, including surrounding wetlands. This area is protected by the Nepali Army.
          </p>
          <h2>Features</h2>
          <p>
            Rara Lake lies at an elevation of 2,975 m (9,760 ft), spans a surface area of 10.8 km<sup>2</sup>, and reaches a maximum depth of 167 m (548 ft). The lake is surrounded by thickly forested hills, with stunning views of the Himalayan Range, and is known to change colors up to five times a day, depending on the climate.
          </p>
          <h2>Socio-cultural and Religious Values</h2>
          <p>
            The local Thakur society around the lake relies primarily on agriculture, goat herding, and the sale of medicinal herbs. The Thakur Baba's Temple, located in the southeast corner of the lake, holds significant cultural importance, with locals believing that the god Thakur opened the lake's passage to prevent flooding.
          </p>
          <h2>Flora and Fauna</h2>
          <p>
            Rara National Park, established to protect the lake and its surroundings, is home to 1,074 plant species, 16 of which are endemic to Nepal, 51 mammal species, and 214 bird species. The lake also has unique endemic fish species, including the Rara snowtrout and an endemic frog species, the Rara Lake frog.
          </p>
          <h2>Climate</h2>
          <p>
            The climate at Rara Lake is generally pleasant in summer but can be extremely cold in winter. The best time to visit is between September-October or April-May. During winter, temperatures drop below freezing, and heavy snowfall can block access to the lake.
          </p>
          <h2>Transport</h2>
          <p>
            Though not connected to the national road network, Rara Lake can be reached by air or road. The nearest airport is Talcha Airport in Mugu, accessible via Nepalgunj or Surkhet. By road, it takes approximately four days to reach Rara from Kathmandu through the Karnali Highway, or three days from Jumla with additional trekking.
